# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classifier

A deep learning-powered web application for automated chest X-ray analysis and pneumonia detection. Built with FastAPI, PyTorch, and vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, this application provides real-time medical image analysis with confidence scoring.

## 🏥 Overview

This application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a balanced dataset of **pediatric chest X-ray images** to classify between normal and pneumonia cases. The model achieves 85% accuracy on the test set and provides confidence scores for predictions.

**Important Note**: This model was specifically trained on pediatric chest X-rays and is optimized for analyzing chest X-rays from children and adolescents. While it may work on adult chest X-rays, the highest accuracy is achieved with pediatric cases.

## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### Pediatric Focus
This application is specifically designed for pediatric chest X-ray analysis. The model was trained on chest X-rays from children and adolescents, making it particularly effective for pediatric cases. While it can analyze adult chest X-rays, the highest accuracy and reliability are achieved with pediatric images.

### Confidence Threshold
The application uses a confidence threshold of 0.85 to ensure reliable predictions. When the model's confidence is below this threshold, it returns "UNCERTAIN" rather than making potentially incorrect predictions.

### Uncertainty Handling
```python
if confidence < threshold:
    predicted_class = "UNCERTAIN"
```

### Real-time Processing
Images are processed in real-time with the following pipeline:
1. Image upload and validation
2. Preprocessing (resize, normalize, convert to grayscale)
3. Model inference
4. Confidence calculation
5. Result formatting and display

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: Images are processed in memory and not stored
- **Input Validation**: File type and size validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for invalid inputs
- **CORS Enabled**: Configured for web application access

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is deployed on Railway with the following configuration:

- **Backend**: FastAPI application with static file serving
- **Frontend**: Integrated HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Model**: Pre-trained PyTorch model loaded at startup
- **Database**: No database required (stateless application)
